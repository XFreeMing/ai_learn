1
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:08,866
So supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output or X to Y mapping.

2
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:20,081
And in the last video you saw that regression algorithms, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm learns to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers.

3
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:25,603
There's a second major type of supervised learning algorithm called a classification algorithm.

4
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:28,935
Let's take a look at what this means.

5
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:35,102
Take breast cancer detection as an example of a classification problem.

6
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:41,389
Say you're building a machine learning system so that doctors can have a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer.

7
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:46,753
This is important because early detection could potentially save a patient's life.

8
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:57,311
Using a patient's medical records your machine learning system tries to figure out if a tumor that is a lump is malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous.

9
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:10,882
Or if that tumor, that lump is benign, meaning that it's just a lump that isn't cancerous and isn't that dangerous? Some of my friends have actually been working on this specific problem.

10
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:15,552
So maybe your dataset has tumors of various sizes.

11
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:28,529
And these tumors are labeled as either benign, which I will designate in this example with a 0 or malignant, which will designate in this example with a 1.

12
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:48,023
You can then plot your data on a graph like this where the horizontal axis represents the size of the tumor and the vertical axis takes on only two values 0 or 1 depending on whether the tumor is benign, 0 or malignant 1.

13
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,471
One reason that this is different from regression is that we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories.

14
00:01:49,471 --> 00:02:04,510
In this case two possible outputs 0 or 1, benign or malignant.

15
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:14,637
This is different from regression which tries to predict any number, all of the infinitely many number of possible numbers.

16
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:21,275
And so the fact that there are only two possible outputs is what makes this classification.

17
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:32,887
Because there are only two possible outputs or two possible categories in this example, you can also plot this data set on a line like this.

18
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:47,395
Right now, I'm going to use two different symbols to denote the category using a circle an O to denote the benign examples and a cross to denote the malignant examples.

19
00:02:47,395 --> 00:03:09,874
And if new patients walks in for a diagnosis and they have a lump that is this size, then the question is, will your system classify this tumor as benign or malignant? It turns out that in classification problems you can also have more than two possible output categories.

20
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:17,474
Maybe you're learning algorithm can output multiple types of cancer diagnosis if it turns out to be malignant.

21
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:22,497
So let's call two different types of cancer type 1 and type 2.

22
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:29,864
In this case the average would have three possible output categories it could predict.

23
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:37,804
And by the way in classification, the terms output classes and output categories are often used interchangeably.

24
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:44,097
So what I say class or category when referring to the output, it means the same thing.

25
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:50,914
So to summarize classification algorithms predict categories.

26
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:52,754
Categories don't have to be numbers.

27
00:03:52,754 --> 00:04:01,737
It could be non numeric for example, it can predict whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog.

28
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:07,016
And it can predict if a tumor is benign or malignant.

29
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:12,930
Categories can also be numbers like 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2.

30
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:34,469
But what makes classification different from regression when you're interpreting the numbers is that classification predicts a small finite limited set of possible output categories such as 0, 1 and 2 but not all possible numbers in between like 0.5 or 1.7.

31
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:45,023
In the example of supervised learning that we've been looking at, we had only one input value the size of the tumor.

32
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:51,086
But you can also use more than one input value to predict an output.

33
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:59,391
Here's an example, instead of just knowing the tumor size, say you also have each patient's age in years.

34
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:04,941
Your new data set now has two inputs, age and tumor size.

35
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:17,327
What in this new dataset we're going to use circles to show patients whose tumors are benign and crosses to show the patients with a tumor that was malignant.

36
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:25,394
So when a new patient comes in, the doctor can measure the patient's tumor size and also record the patient's age.

37
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:44,105
And so given this, how can we predict if this patient's tumor is benign or malignant? Well, given the day said like this, what the learning algorithm might do is find some boundary that separates out the malignant tumors from the benign ones.

38
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:50,423
So the learning algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line through this data.

39
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:55,620
The boundary line found by the learning algorithm would help the doctor with the diagnosis.

40
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,795
In this case the tumor is more likely to be benign.

41
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:07,060
From this example we have seen how to inputs the patient's age and tumor size can be used.

42
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,995
In other machine learning problems often many more input values are required.

43
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:24,469
My friends who worked on breast cancer detection use many additional inputs, like the thickness of the tumor clump, uniformity of the cell size, uniformity of the cell shape and so on.

44
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:35,673
So to recap supervised learning maps input x to output y, where the learning algorithm learns from the quote right answers.

45
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:41,197
The two major types of supervised learning our regression and classification.

46
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:50,618
In a regression application like predicting prices of houses, the learning algorithm has to predict numbers from infinitely many possible output numbers.

47
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:58,802
Whereas in classification the learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs.

48
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:05,288
So you now know what is supervised learning, including both regression and classification.

49
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:06,902
I hope you're having fun.

50
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:12,694
Next there's a second major type of machine learning called unsupervised learning.
