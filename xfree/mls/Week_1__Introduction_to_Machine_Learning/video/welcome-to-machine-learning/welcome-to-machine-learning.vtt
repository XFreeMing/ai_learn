Welcome to Machine learning.

3
00:00:05.850 --&gt; 00:00:07.720
What is machine learning?

4
00:00:07.720 --&gt; 00:00:11.519
You probably use it many times
a day without even knowing it.

5
00:00:11.519 --&gt; 00:00:15.950
Anytime you want to find out something
like how do I make a sushi roll?

6
00:00:15.950 --&gt; 00:00:20.670
You can do a web search on Google,
Bing or Baidu to find out.

7
00:00:20.670 --&gt; 00:00:25.392
And that works so well because their
machine learning software has figured out

8
00:00:25.392 --&gt; 00:00:26.761
how to rank web pages.

9
00:00:26.761 --&gt; 00:00:30.242
Or when you upload pictures
to Instagram or Snapchat and

10
00:00:30.242 --&gt; 00:00:34.850
think to yourself, I want to tag my
friends so they can see their pictures.

11
00:00:34.850 --&gt; 00:00:39.980
Well these apps can recognize your friends
in your pictures and label them as well.

12
00:00:39.980 --&gt; 00:00:42.100
That's also machine learning.

13
00:00:42.100 --&gt; 00:00:46.077
Or if you've just finished watching
a Star Wars movie on the video

14
00:00:46.077 --&gt; 00:00:50.440
streaming service and you think what
other similar movies can I watch?

15
00:00:50.440 --&gt; 00:00:55.136
Well the streaming service will likely use
machine learning to recommend something

16
00:00:55.136 --&gt; 00:00:56.335
that you might like.

17
00:00:56.335 --&gt; 00:01:00.350
Each time you use voice to text on
your phone to write a text message.

18
00:01:00.350 --&gt; 00:01:02.195
&gt;&gt; Hey Andrew, how's it going?

19
00:01:02.195 --&gt; 00:01:03.493
&gt;&gt; Or tell your phone.

20
00:01:03.493 --&gt; 00:01:05.653
Hey Siri play a song by Rihanna,

21
00:01:05.653 --&gt; 00:01:10.461
or ask your other phone okay Google
show me Indian restaurants near me.

22
00:01:11.540 --&gt; 00:01:13.450
That's also machine learning.

23
00:01:13.450 --&gt; 00:01:17.131
Each time you receive an email titled,
Congratulations!

24
00:01:17.131 --&gt; 00:01:18.900
You've won a million dollars.

25
00:01:18.900 --&gt; 00:01:20.960
Well maybe you're rich, congratulations.

26
00:01:20.960 --&gt; 00:01:25.740
Or more likely your email service
will probably flag it as spam.

27
00:01:25.740 --&gt; 00:01:29.079
That too is an application
of machine learning.

28
00:01:29.079 --&gt; 00:01:33.817
Beyond consumer applications that
you might use, AI is also rapidly

29
00:01:33.817 --&gt; 00:01:38.647
making its way into big companies and
into industrial applications.

30
00:01:38.647 --&gt; 00:01:44.014
For example, I'm deeply concerned about
climate change, and I'm glad to see

31
00:01:44.014 --&gt; 00:01:49.801
that machine learning is already hoping to
optimize wind turbine power generation.

32
00:01:49.801 --&gt; 00:01:51.098
Or in healthcare,

33
00:01:51.098 --&gt; 00:01:57.440
is starting to make its way into hospitals
to help doctors make accurate diagnosis.

34
00:01:57.440 --&gt; 00:02:00.892
Or recently at Landing AI have
been doing a lot of work,

35
00:02:00.892 --&gt; 00:02:05.699
putting computer vision into factories
to help inspect if something coming

36
00:02:05.699 --&gt; 00:02:09.139
off the assembly line has any defects.

37
00:02:09.139 --&gt; 00:02:10.884
That's machine learning,

38
00:02:10.884 --&gt; 00:02:16.277
it's the science of getting computers to
learn without being explicitly programmed.

39
00:02:16.277 --&gt; 00:02:19.672
In this course,
you learn about machine learning and

40
00:02:19.672 --&gt; 00:02:23.240
get to implement machine learning and
code yourself.

41
00:02:23.240 --&gt; 00:02:27.174
Millions of others have taken
the earlier version of this course,

42
00:02:27.174 --&gt; 00:02:30.626
which is of course,
that led to the founding of Coursera.

43
00:02:30.626 --&gt; 00:02:34.933
And many learners ended up building
exciting machine learning systems or

44
00:02:34.933 --&gt; 00:02:38.240
even pursuing very
successful careers in AI.

45
00:02:38.240 --&gt; 00:02:41.040
I'm excited that you're
on this journey with me.

46
00:02:41.040 --&gt; 00:02:42.751
Welcome and let's get started.
