This Week, you'll extend linear regression to handle multiple input features. 
> - extend: 扩展

You'll also learn some methods for improving your model's training and performance, such as vectorization,feature scaling, feature engineering and polynomial regression.
> - also: 还
> - improve: 改进
> - performance: 性能
> - vectorization: 矢量化
> - feature scaling: 特征缩放
> - polynomial regression: 多项式回归

At the end of the week, you'll get to practice implementing linear regression in code.
> - at the end of: 在...结束时
> - practice: 实践
