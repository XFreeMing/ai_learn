# Instructions
This week, you'll learn the other type of supervised learning, classification.
You'll learn how to predict categories using the logistic regression model.

> - predict: 预测
> - categories: 类别

You'll learn about the problem of overfitting, and how to handle this problem with a method called regularization.

> - overfitting: 过拟合
> - handle: 处理
> - called: 称为
> - regularization: 正则化

You'll get to practice implementing logistic regression with regularization at the end of this week.
> - get to: 得以
> - practice: 实践
> - implementing: 实现
