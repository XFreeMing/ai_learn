00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.830
In this class, you'll learn about the state of the art and also practice implementing machine learning algorithms yourself.

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:21.780
You'll learn about the most important machine learning algorithms, some of which are exactly what's being used in large AI or large tech companies today and you get a sense of what is the state of the art in AI.

3
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:31.170
Beyond learning the algorithms though, in this class, you'll also learn all the important practical tips and tricks for making them perform well.

4
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.665
You get to implement them and see how they work for yourself.

5
00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:45.020
Why is machine learning so widely used today? Machine Learning had grown up as a sub-field of AI or artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.350
We wanted to build intelligent machines.

7
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.810
It turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from a to b, like in your GPS.

8
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:10.060
But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car.

9
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.545
The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself.

10
00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:38.245
For me, when I founded and was leading the Google Brain Team, I worked on problems like speech recognition, computer vision for Google Maps, Street View images and advertising, or leading AI Baidu, I worked on everything from AI for augmented reality to combating payment fraud to leading a self-driving car team.

11
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:49.985
Most recently, at landing.AI, AI Fund and Stanford University, I'm beginning to work on AI applications in the factory, large-scale agriculture, health care, e-commerce, and other problems.

12
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:59.205
Today, there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people working on machine learning applications who could tell you similar stories about their work with machine learning.

13
00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:08.585
When you've learned these skills, I hope that you too will find the great fun to dabble in exciting different applications and maybe even different industries.

14
00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:17.465
In fact, I find it hard to think of any industry that machine learning is unlikely to touch in a significant way now or in the near future.

15
00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:28.480
Looking even further into the future, many people, including me, are excited about the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as you or me.

16
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.705
This is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence or AGI.

17
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:39.200
I think AGI has been overhyped and we're still a long way away from that goal.

18
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.380
I don't know. It'll take 50 years or 500 years or longer to get there.

19
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.040
But mostly AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer toward that goal is by using learning algorithms.

20
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.015
Maybe ones that take some inspiration from how the human brain works.

21
00:02:56.015 --> 00:03:01.640
You also hear a little more about this Quest for AGI later in this course.

22
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:13.625
According to a study by McKinsey, AI and machine learning is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030.

23
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:33.850
Even though machine learning is already creating tremendous amounts of value in the software industry, I think there could be even vastly greater value that has yet to be created outside the software industry in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials manufacturing, and so on.

24
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:44.290
Because of the massive untapped opportunities across so many different sectors, today there is a vast unfulfilled demand for this skill set.

25
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.925
That's why this is such a great time to be learning about machine learning.

26
00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:55.685
If you find machine learning applications exciting, I hope you stick with me through this class.

27
00:03:55.685 --> 00:04:01.060
I can almost guarantee that you'll find mastering these skills worthwhile.

28
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.550
In the next video, we'll look at a more formal definition of what is machine learning.

29
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.699
And we'll begin to talk about the main types of machine learning problems and algorithms.

30
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:24.710
You pick up some of the main machine learning terminology and start to get a sense of what are the different algorithms and when each one might be appropriate.

31
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.710
So let's go on to the next video.
