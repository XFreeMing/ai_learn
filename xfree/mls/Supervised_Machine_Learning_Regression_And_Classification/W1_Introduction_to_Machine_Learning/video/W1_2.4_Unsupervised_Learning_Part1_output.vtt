00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:08.003
After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:16.551
Let's take a look at what that means, we've talked about supervised learning and this video is about unsupervised learning.

3
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:24.754
But don't let the name uncivilized for you, unsupervised learning is I think just as super as supervised learning.

4
00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:32.243
When we're looking at supervised learning in the last video recalled, it looks something like this in the case of a classification problem.

5
00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:43.493
Each example, was associated with an output label y such as benign or malignant, designated by the poles and crosses in unsupervised learning.

6
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:55.214
Were given data that isn't associated with any output labels y, say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age.

7
00:00:55.214 --> 00:01:03.257
But not whether the tumor was benign or malignant, so the dataset looks like this on the right.

8
00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:11.652
We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we're not given any labels.

9
00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:20.716
Why in the dataset, instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data.

10
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:27.856
This is unsupervised learning, we call it unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm.

11
00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:37.223
To give some quote right answer for every input, instead, we asked the our room to figure out all by yourself what's interesting.

12
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:43.417
Or what patterns or structures that might be in this data, with this particular data set.

13
00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:51.918
An unsupervised learning algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters.

14
00:01:51.918 --> 00:02:03.130
And so it might decide, that there's one cluster what group over here, and there's another cluster or group over here.

15
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.671
This is a particular type of unsupervised learning, called a clustering algorithm.

16
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:17.151
Because it places the unlabeled data, into different clusters and this turns out to be used in many applications.

17
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:25.870
For example, clustering is used in google news, what google news does is every day it goes.

18
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.719
And looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet, and groups related stories together.

19
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:41.831
For example, here is a sample from Google News, where the headline of the top article, is giant panda gives birth to rear twin cubs at Japan's oldest zoo.

20
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:48.664
This article has actually caught my eye, because my daughter loves pandas and so there are a lot of stuff panda toys.

21
00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:59.589
And watching panda videos in my house, and looking at this, you might notice that below this are other related articles.

22
00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:05.633
Maybe from the headlines alone, you can start to guess what clustering might be doing.

23
00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:21.481
Notice that the word panda appears here here, here, here and here and notice that the word twin also appears in all five articles.

24
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:29.309
And the word Zoo also appears in all of these articles, so the clustering algorithm is finding articles.

25
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:39.161
All of all the hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet that day, finding the articles that mention similar words and grouping them into clusters.

26
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:47.463
Now, what's cool is that this clustering algorithm figures out on his own which words suggest, that certain articles are in the same group.

27
00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:54.128
What I mean is there isn't an employee at google news who's telling the algorithm to find articles that the word panda.

28
00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:59.783
And twins and zoo to put them into the same cluster, the news topics change every day.

29
00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:08.837
And there are so many news stories, it just isn't feasible to people doing this every single day for all the topics that use covers.

30
00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:17.622
Instead the algorithm has to figure out on his own without supervision, what are the clusters of news articles today.

31
00:04:17.622 --> 00:04:23.773
So that's why this clustering algorithm, is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm.

32
00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:31.568
Let's look at the second example of unsupervised learning applied to clustering genetic or DNA data.

33
00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:38.189
This image shows a picture of DNA micro array data, these look like tiny grids of a spreadsheet.

34
00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:50.651
And each tiny column represents the genetic or DNA activity of one person, So for example, this entire Column here is from one person's DNA.

35
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:57.816
And this other column is of another person, each row represents a particular gene.

36
00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:09.640
So just as an example, perhaps this role here might represent a gene that affects eye color, or this role here is a gene that affects how tall someone is.

37
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:19.015
Researchers have even found a genetic link to whether someone dislikes certain vegetables, such as broccoli, or brussels sprouts, or asparagus.

38
00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:28.003
So next time someone asks you why didn't you finish your salad, you can tell them, maybe it's genetic for DNA micro race.

39
00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:33.720
The idea is to measure how much certain genes, are expressed for each individual person.

40
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:44.446
So these colors red, green, gray, and so on, show the degree to which different individuals do, or do not have a specific gene active.

41
00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:51.986
And what you can do is then run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into different categories.

42
00:05:51.986 --> 00:06:00.533
Or different types of people like maybe these individuals that group together, and let's just call this type one.

43
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:08.851
And these people are grouped into type two, and these people are groups as type three.

44
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:16.254
This is unsupervised learning, because we're not telling the algorithm in advance, that there is a type one person with certain characteristics.

45
00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:21.824
Or a type two person with certain characteristics, instead what we're saying is here's a bunch of data.

46
00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:28.243
I don't know what the different types of people are but can you automatically find structure into data.

47
00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:36.574
And automatically figure out whether the major types of individuals, since we're not giving the algorithm the right answer for the examples in advance.

48
00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:47.215
This is unsupervised learning, here's the third example, many companies have huge databases of customer information given this data.

49
00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:56.243
Can you automatically group your customers, into different market segments so that you can more efficiently serve your customers.

50
00:06:56.243 --> 00:07:02.553
Concretely the deep learning dot AI team did some research to better understand the deep learning dot AI community.

51
00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:11.459
And why different individuals take these classes, subscribed to the batch weekly newsletter, or attend our AI events.

52
00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:18.409
Let's visualize the deep learning dot AI community, as this collection of people running clustering.

53
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:30.242
That is market segmentation found a few distinct groups of individuals, one group's primary motivation is seeking knowledge to grow their skills.

54
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:38.043
Perhaps this is you, and so that's great, a second group's primary motivation is looking for a way to develop their career.

55
00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:45.135
Maybe you want to get a promotion or a new job, or make some career progression if this describes you, that's great too.

56
00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:54.209
And yet another group wants to stay updated on how AI impacts their field of work, perhaps this is you, that's great too.

57
00:07:54.209 --> 00:08:01.237
This is a clustering that our team used to try to better serve our community as we're trying to figure out.

58
00:08:01.237 --> 00:08:10.211
Whether the major categories of learners in the deeper and community, So if any of these is your top motivation for learning, that's great.

59
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:19.615
And I hope I'll be able to help you on your journey, or in case this is you, and you want something totally different than the other three categories.

60
00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:26.688
That's fine too, and I want you to know, I love you all the same, so to summarize a clustering algorithm.

61
00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:35.385
Which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters.

62
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:42.211
And so maybe the next time you see or think of a panda, maybe you think of clustering as well.

63
00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:47.032
And besides clustering, there are other types of unsupervised learning as well.

64
00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:52.151
Let's go on to the next video, to take a look at some other types of unsupervised learning algorithms.
