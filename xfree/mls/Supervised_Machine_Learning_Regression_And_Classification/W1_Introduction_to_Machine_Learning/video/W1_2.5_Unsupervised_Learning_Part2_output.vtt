00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.025
In the last video, you saw what is unsupervised learning, and one type of unsupervised learning called clustering.

2
00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:17.640
Let's give a slightly more formal definition of unsupervised learning and take a quick look at some other types of unsupervised learning other than clustering.

3
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:36.600
Whereas in supervised learning, the data comes with both inputs x and input labels y, in unsupervised learning, the data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.

4
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.805
We're seeing just one example of unsupervised learning called a clustering algorithm, which groups similar data points together.

5
00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:53.390
In this specialization, you'll learn about clustering as well as two other types of unsupervised learning.

6
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.870
One is called anomaly detection, which is used to detect unusual events.

7
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:13.030
This turns out to be really important for fraud detection in the financial system, where unusual events, unusual transactions could be signs of fraud and for many other applications.

8
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.105
You also learn about dimensionality reduction.

9
00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:26.935
This lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible.

10
00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:33.020
In case anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction don't seem to make too much sense to you yet.

11
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.120
Don't worry about it. We'll get to this later in the specialization.

12
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:47.620
Now, I'd like to ask you another question to help you check your understanding, and no pressure, if you don't get it right on the first try, is totally fine.

13
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.200
Please select any of the following that you think are examples of unsupervised learning.

14
00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.650
Two are unsupervised examples and two are supervised learning examples. Please take a look.

15
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.670
Maybe you remember the spam filtering problem.

16
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.275
If you have labeled data you now label as spam or non-spam e-mail, you can treat this as a supervised learning problem.

17
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:18.175
The second example, the news story example.

18
00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:23.690
That's exactly the Google News and tangible example that you saw in the last video.

19
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.515
You can approach that using a clustering algorithm to group news articles together.

20
00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.465
That we'll use unsupervised learning.

21
00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:36.810
The market segmentation example that I talked about a little bit earlier.

22
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:47.600
You can do that as an unsupervised learning problem as well because you can give your algorithm some data and ask it to discover market segments automatically.

23
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.620
The final example on diagnosing diabetes.

24
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.775
Well, actually that's a lot like our breast cancer example from the supervised learning videos.

25
00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:04.205
Only instead of benign or malignant tumors, we instead have diabetes or not diabetes.

26
00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:10.990
You can approach this as a supervised learning problem, just like we did for the breast tumor classification problem.

27
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:25.135
Even though in the last video, we've talked mainly about clustering, in later videos, in this specialization, we'll dive much more deeply into anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction as well.

28
00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:27.885
That's unsupervised learning.

29
00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:36.545
Before we wrap up this section, I want to share with you something that I find really exciting, and useful, which is the use of Jupyter Notebooks in machine learning.

30
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:39.510
Let's take a look at that in the next video.
