00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:10.000
From the videos, you've seen supervised learning and unsupervised learning and also examples of both.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.615
For you to more deeply understand these concepts, I'll like to invite you in this class to see, learn and maybe later write codes yourself to implement these concepts.

3
00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:27.910
The most widely used tool by machine learning and data science practitioners today is the Jupyter Notebook.

4
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.585
This is the default environments that a lot of us use to code up and experiment and try things out.

5
00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:44.515
In this class, right here in your web browser, you build a user Jupyter Notebook environment to test out some of these ideas for yourself as well.

6
00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:56.890
This is not some made up simplified environment, this is the exact same environments, the exact same tool, the Jupyter Notebook that developers are using in many large countries right now.

7
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:09.235
One type of lab that you see throughout this class are optional labs, which are ones you can open and run one line at a time with usually no need to write any code yourself.

8
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:19.535
Optional labs are designed to be very easy and I can guarantee you will get full marks, every single one of them because there are no marks.

9
00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:24.220
All you need to do is open it up and just run the code we've provided.

10
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.255
By reading through and running the code in the optional labs, you see how machine learning code runs.

11
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:39.875
You should complete them relatively quickly just by running it one line at a time from top to bottom.

12
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:58.265
Optional labs are completely optional so you don't have to do them at all if you don't want to, but I hope you will take a look because running through them will give you a deeper feel, give you a little bit more experience with what machine learning algorithms, what machine learning code actually looks like.

13
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:07.190
Starting next week, there'll also be some practice labs which would give you an opportunity to write some of that code yourself but we'll get to that next week.

14
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.960
Don't worry about it for now and I hope you just go through the next optional lab and get through the rest of the content for this week.

15
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.260
Let's take a look at an example of a notebook.

16
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.870
Here's what you see when you go to the first optional lab.

17
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.520
Feel free to scroll up and down and browse and mouseover the different menus and take a look at the different options here.

18
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:39.475
You might notice that there are two types of these blocks, also called cells in the notebook and there are two types of cells.

19
00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:46.035
One is what's called a Markdown cell, which means a bunch of tax.

20
00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:54.540
Here you can actually edit the text if you don't like the text that we wrote, but this is text that describes the code.

21
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.335
Then there's a second type of block or cell which looks like this, which has a code cell.

22
00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:25.765
Here, we've already provided the code and if you want to run this code cell, hitting Shift Enter will run the code in this code cell, and by the way, if you click on a markdown cell, so this showing all this formatting, go ahead and hit Shift Enter on your keyboard as well and that will also convert back to this nicely formatted text.

23
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:33.835
This optional lab shows some common Python code, so you can go ahead and run this afterwards in your own Jupyter notebook.

24
00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:41.320
When you jump into this notebook yourself, what I'd like you to do is select the cells and hit Shift Enter.

25
00:03:41.320 --> 00:04:00.415
Read through the code, see if it makes sense, try to make a prediction about what you think this code would do and then hit Shift Enter and then see what the code actually does, and if you like it, feel free to go in and edit the code, change the code, and then run it and see what happens.

26
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:08.330
If you haven't played in the Jupyter Notebook environment for, I hope you become more familiar with Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

27
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.680
I spend a lot of hours playing around in Jupyter notebooks and so I hope you have fun with them too.

28
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:25.535
After that, I look forward to seeing you in the next video where we'll take the supervised learning problem as start to flesh out our first supervised learning algorithm.

29
00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:29.190
I hope that will be fun to you and look forward to seeing you there.
