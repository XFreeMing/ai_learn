[MUSIC] Welcome to Machine learning.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.519
What is machine learning? You probably use it many times a day without even knowing it.

3
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.670
Anytime you want to find out something like how do I make a sushi roll? You can do a web search on Google, Bing or Baidu to find out.

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.761
And that works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank web pages.

5
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:34.850
Or when you upload pictures to Instagram or Snapchat and think to yourself, I want to tag my friends so they can see their pictures.

6
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.980
Well these apps can recognize your friends in your pictures and label them as well.

7
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.100
That's also machine learning.

8
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:56.335
Or if you've just finished watching a Star Wars movie on the video streaming service and you think what other similar movies can I watch? Well the streaming service will likely use machine learning to recommend something that you might like.

9
00:00:56.335 --> 00:01:00.350
Each time you use voice to text on your phone to write a text message.

10
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.493
>> Hey Andrew, how's it going? >> Or tell your phone.

11
00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:10.461
Hey Siri play a song by Rihanna, or ask your other phone okay Google show me Indian restaurants near me.

12
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.450
That's also machine learning.

13
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.900
Each time you receive an email titled, Congratulations! You've won a million dollars.

14
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960
Well maybe you're rich, congratulations.

15
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.740
Or more likely your email service will probably flag it as spam.

16
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.079
That too is an application of machine learning.

17
00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:38.647
Beyond consumer applications that you might use, AI is also rapidly making its way into big companies and into industrial applications.

18
00:01:38.647 --> 00:01:49.801
For example, I'm deeply concerned about climate change, and I'm glad to see that machine learning is already hoping to optimize wind turbine power generation.

19
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:57.440
Or in healthcare, is starting to make its way into hospitals to help doctors make accurate diagnosis.

20
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:09.139
Or recently at Landing AI have been doing a lot of work, putting computer vision into factories to help inspect if something coming off the assembly line has any defects.

21
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.277
That's machine learning, it's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

22
00:02:16.277 --> 00:02:23.240
In this course, you learn about machine learning and get to implement machine learning and code yourself.

23
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.626
Millions of others have taken the earlier version of this course, which is of course, that led to the founding of Coursera.

24
00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:38.240
And many learners ended up building exciting machine learning systems or even pursuing very successful careers in AI.

25
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.040
I'm excited that you're on this journey with me.

26
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.751
Welcome and let's get started.
