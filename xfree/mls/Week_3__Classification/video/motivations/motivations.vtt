Welcome to the third week of this course.

2
00:00:03.053 --&gt; 00:00:04.324
By the end of this week,

3
00:00:04.324 --&gt; 00:00:07.640
you have completed the first
course of this specialization.

4
00:00:07.640 --&gt; 00:00:09.962
So let's jump in.

5
00:00:09.962 --&gt; 00:00:14.455
Last week you learned about linear
regression, which predicts a number.

6
00:00:14.455 --&gt; 00:00:19.387
This week, you learn about classification
where your output variable y can

7
00:00:19.387 --&gt; 00:00:24.320
take on only one of a small handful of
possible values instead of any number in

8
00:00:24.320 --&gt; 00:00:26.340
an infinite range of numbers.

9
00:00:26.340 --&gt; 00:00:30.308
It turns out that linear regression
is not a good algorithm for

10
00:00:30.308 --&gt; 00:00:32.149
classification problems.

11
00:00:32.149 --&gt; 00:00:33.995
Let's take a look at why and

12
00:00:33.995 --&gt; 00:00:39.060
this will lead us into a different
algorithm called logistic regression.

13
00:00:39.060 --&gt; 00:00:43.032
Which is one of the most popular and most
widely used learning algorithms today.

14
00:00:43.032 --&gt; 00:00:47.354
Here are some examples of
classification problems recall

15
00:00:47.354 --&gt; 00:00:51.858
the example of trying to figure
out whether an email is spam.

16
00:00:51.858 --&gt; 00:00:57.370
So the answer you want to output is
going to be either a no or a yes.

17
00:00:57.370 --&gt; 00:01:01.830
Another example would be figuring
out if an online financial

18
00:01:01.830 --&gt; 00:01:04.022
transaction is fraudulent.

19
00:01:04.022 --&gt; 00:01:07.927
Fighting online financial fraud
is something I once worked on and

20
00:01:07.927 --&gt; 00:01:09.922
it was strangely exhilarating.

21
00:01:09.922 --&gt; 00:01:14.584
Because I knew there were forces
out there trying to steal money and

22
00:01:14.584 --&gt; 00:01:16.840
my team's job was to stop them.

23
00:01:16.840 --&gt; 00:01:20.780
So the problem is given
a financial transaction.

24
00:01:20.780 --&gt; 00:01:26.186
Can your learning algorithm figure
out is this transaction fraudulent,

25
00:01:26.186 --&gt; 00:01:28.984
such as what this credit card stolen?

26
00:01:28.984 --&gt; 00:01:33.576
Another example we've
touched on before was trying

27
00:01:33.576 --&gt; 00:01:37.550
to classify a tumor as
malignant versus not.

28
00:01:37.550 --&gt; 00:01:41.888
In each of these problems the variable
that you want to predict can

29
00:01:41.888 --&gt; 00:01:44.311
only be one of two possible values.

30
00:01:44.311 --&gt; 00:01:46.240
No or yes.

31
00:01:46.240 --&gt; 00:01:50.866
This type of classification problem where
there are only two possible outputs is

32
00:01:50.866 --&gt; 00:01:52.780
called binary classification.

33
00:01:52.780 --&gt; 00:01:56.891
Where the word binary
refers to there being only

34
00:01:56.891 --&gt; 00:02:01.320
two possible classes or
two possible categories.

35
00:02:01.320 --&gt; 00:02:05.611
In these problems I will
use the terms class and

36
00:02:05.611 --&gt; 00:02:09.474
category relatively interchangeably.

37
00:02:09.474 --&gt; 00:02:11.806
They mean basically the same thing.

38
00:02:11.806 --&gt; 00:02:15.645
By convention we can refer
to these two classes or

39
00:02:15.645 --&gt; 00:02:18.273
categories in a few common ways.

40
00:02:18.273 --&gt; 00:02:22.369
We often designate clauses as no or yes or

41
00:02:22.369 --&gt; 00:02:26.466
sometimes equivalently false or true or

42
00:02:26.466 --&gt; 00:02:31.053
very commonly using the numbers zero or
one.

43
00:02:31.053 --&gt; 00:02:35.611
Following the common convention
in computer science with zero

44
00:02:35.611 --&gt; 00:02:38.450
denoting falls and one denoting true.

45
00:02:38.450 --&gt; 00:02:44.006
I'm usually going to use the numbers
zero and one to represent the answer y.

46
00:02:44.006 --&gt; 00:02:48.935
Because that will fit in most easily
with the types of learning algorithms we

47
00:02:48.935 --&gt; 00:02:50.174
want to implement.

48
00:02:50.174 --&gt; 00:02:56.945
But when we talk about it will often
say no or yes or false or true as well.

49
00:02:56.945 --&gt; 00:03:01.651
One of the technologies commonly used
is to call the false or zero class.

50
00:03:01.651 --&gt; 00:03:09.055
The negative class and the true or
the one class, the positive class.

51
00:03:09.055 --&gt; 00:03:12.051
For example, for spam classification,

52
00:03:12.051 --&gt; 00:03:16.767
an email that is not spam may be
referred to as a negative example.

53
00:03:16.767 --&gt; 00:03:19.811
Because the output to
the question of is a spam.

54
00:03:19.811 --&gt; 00:03:22.961
The output is no or zero.

55
00:03:22.961 --&gt; 00:03:24.108
In contrast,

56
00:03:24.108 --&gt; 00:03:30.134
an email that has spam might be referred
to as a positive training example.

57
00:03:30.134 --&gt; 00:03:33.714
Because the answer to is it spam is yes or

58
00:03:33.714 --&gt; 00:03:38.172
true or one to be clear,
negative and positive.

59
00:03:38.172 --&gt; 00:03:42.355
Do not necessarily mean bad versus good or
evil versus good.

60
00:03:42.355 --&gt; 00:03:44.167
It's just that negative and

61
00:03:44.167 --&gt; 00:03:48.621
positive examples are used to convey
the concepts of absence or zero or

62
00:03:48.621 --&gt; 00:03:53.320
false vs the presence or true or
one of something you might be looking for.

63
00:03:53.320 --&gt; 00:03:57.357
Such as the absence or
presence of the spam illness or

64
00:03:57.357 --&gt; 00:04:02.679
the spam property of an email or
the absence of presence of broadening

65
00:04:02.679 --&gt; 00:04:07.380
activity or absence of presence
of malignancy of the tumor.

66
00:04:07.380 --&gt; 00:04:10.091
Between non spam and spam emails.

67
00:04:10.091 --&gt; 00:04:14.662
Which one you call false or
zero and which one you call true or

68
00:04:14.662 --&gt; 00:04:17.050
one is a little bit arbitrary.

69
00:04:17.050 --&gt; 00:04:20.067
Often either choice could work.

70
00:04:20.067 --&gt; 00:04:24.342
So, different engineer might actually swap
it around and have the positive class B.

71
00:04:24.342 --&gt; 00:04:29.567
The presence of a good email or
the possible causes be the presence

72
00:04:29.567 --&gt; 00:04:33.940
of a real financial transaction or
a healthy patient.

73
00:04:33.940 --&gt; 00:04:38.190
So how do you build
a classification algorithm?

74
00:04:38.190 --&gt; 00:04:43.349
Here's the example of a training set for
classifying if the tumor is malignant.

75
00:04:43.349 --&gt; 00:04:47.339
A class one, positive class, yes class or

76
00:04:47.339 --&gt; 00:04:51.102
benign, class zero or negative class.

77
00:04:51.102 --&gt; 00:04:55.545
I plotted both the tumor
size on the horizontal axis

78
00:04:55.545 --&gt; 00:04:59.274
as well as the label Y
on the vertical axis.

79
00:04:59.274 --&gt; 00:05:03.282
By the way, in week one,
when we first talked about classification.

80
00:05:03.282 --&gt; 00:05:08.084
This is how we previously visualized it
on the number line except that now we're

81
00:05:08.084 --&gt; 00:05:09.740
calling the classes zero.

82
00:05:09.740 --&gt; 00:05:14.068
And one and
plotting them on the vertical axis.

83
00:05:14.068 --&gt; 00:05:19.034
Now, one thing you could try on this
training set is to apply the album you

84
00:05:19.034 --&gt; 00:05:20.106
already know.

85
00:05:20.106 --&gt; 00:05:24.856
Linear regression and
try to fit a straight line to the data.

86
00:05:24.856 --&gt; 00:05:28.304
If you do that, maybe the straight
line looks like this, right?

87
00:05:28.304 --&gt; 00:05:31.811
And that's your F effects.

88
00:05:31.811 --&gt; 00:05:35.800
Linear regression predicts not
just the values zero and one.

89
00:05:35.800 --&gt; 00:05:41.347
But all numbers between zero and one or
even less than zero or greater than one.

90
00:05:41.347 --&gt; 00:05:45.640
But here we want to predict categories.

91
00:05:45.640 --&gt; 00:05:51.962
One thing you could try is to
pick a threshold of say 0.5.

92
00:05:51.962 --&gt; 00:05:56.258
So that if the model
outputs a value below 0.5,

93
00:05:56.258 --&gt; 00:06:00.564
then you predict why equal zero or
not malignant.

94
00:06:00.564 --&gt; 00:06:04.366
And if the model outputs
a number equal to or

95
00:06:04.366 --&gt; 00:06:09.977
greater than 0.5,
then predict Y equals one or malignant.

96
00:06:09.977 --&gt; 00:06:14.485
Notice that this threshold
value of 0.5 intersects

97
00:06:14.485 --&gt; 00:06:17.921
the best fit straight line at this point.

98
00:06:17.921 --&gt; 00:06:20.815
So if you draw this vertical line here,

99
00:06:20.815 --&gt; 00:06:25.643
everything to the left ends up with
a prediction of y equals zero.

100
00:06:25.643 --&gt; 00:06:31.148
And everything on the right ends up
with the prediction of y equals one.

101
00:06:31.148 --&gt; 00:06:34.481
Now, for this particular data
set it looks like linear

102
00:06:34.481 --&gt; 00:06:37.240
regression could do something reasonable.

103
00:06:37.240 --&gt; 00:06:42.467
But now let's see what happens if your
dataset has one more training example.

104
00:06:42.467 --&gt; 00:06:46.042
This one way over here on the right.

105
00:06:46.042 --&gt; 00:06:49.005
Let's also extend the horizontal axis.

106
00:06:49.005 --&gt; 00:06:53.822
Notice that this training example
shouldn't really change how you classify

107
00:06:53.822 --&gt; 00:06:54.940
the data points.

108
00:06:54.940 --&gt; 00:06:59.450
This vertical dividing line that we drew
just now still makes sense as the cut off

109
00:06:59.450 --&gt; 00:07:02.971
where tumors smaller than this
should be classified as zero.

110
00:07:02.971 --&gt; 00:07:07.040
And tumors greater than this
should be classified as one.

111
00:07:07.040 --&gt; 00:07:10.338
But once you've added this extra
training example on the right.

112
00:07:10.338 --&gt; 00:07:15.258
The best fit line for linear
regression will shift over like this.

113
00:07:15.258 --&gt; 00:07:20.782
And if you continue using
the threshold of 0.5, you now notice

114
00:07:20.782 --&gt; 00:07:27.323
that everything to the left of this point
is predicted at zero non malignant.

115
00:07:27.323 --&gt; 00:07:32.880
And everything to the right of this point
is predicted to be one or malignant.

116
00:07:32.880 --&gt; 00:07:38.547
This isn't what we want because adding
that example way to the right shouldn't

117
00:07:38.547 --&gt; 00:07:44.650
change any of our conclusions about how to
classify malignant versus benign tumors.

118
00:07:44.650 --&gt; 00:07:47.340
But if you try to do this
with linear regression,

119
00:07:47.340 --&gt; 00:07:51.685
adding this one example which feels
like it shouldn't be changing anything.

120
00:07:51.685 --&gt; 00:07:57.040
It ends up with us learning a much worse
function for this classification problem.

121
00:07:57.040 --&gt; 00:08:03.012
Clearly, when the tumor is large, we want
the algorithm to classify it as malignant.

122
00:08:03.012 --&gt; 00:08:08.388
So what we just saw was linear
regression causes the best fit line.

123
00:08:08.388 --&gt; 00:08:13.063
When we added one more example
to the right to shift over.

124
00:08:13.063 --&gt; 00:08:17.440
And does the dividing line
also called the decision

125
00:08:17.440 --&gt; 00:08:20.610
boundary to shift over to the right.

126
00:08:20.610 --&gt; 00:08:24.888
You learn more about the decision
boundary in the next video,

127
00:08:24.888 --&gt; 00:08:29.342
you also learn about an algorithm
called logistic regression.

128
00:08:29.342 --&gt; 00:08:34.741
Where the output value of the outcome
will always be between zero and one.

129
00:08:34.741 --&gt; 00:08:38.377
And the average will avoid these problems
that we're seeing on this slide.

130
00:08:38.377 --&gt; 00:08:43.617
By the way one thing confusing about
the name logistic regression is that even

131
00:08:43.617 --&gt; 00:08:49.033
though it has the word of regression in
it is actually used for classification.

132
00:08:49.033 --&gt; 00:08:53.487
Don't be confused by the name which
was given for historical reasons.

133
00:08:53.487 --&gt; 00:08:58.178
It's actually used to solve
binary classification problems

134
00:08:58.178 --&gt; 00:09:01.339
with output label y is either zero or one.

135
00:09:01.339 --&gt; 00:09:06.053
In the upcoming optional lab you also
get to take a look at what happens

136
00:09:06.053 --&gt; 00:09:10.128
when you try to use linear regression for
classification.

137
00:09:10.128 --&gt; 00:09:16.352
Sometimes you get lucky and it may
work but often it will not work well.

138
00:09:16.352 --&gt; 00:09:21.141
Which is why I don't use linear
regression myself for classification.

139
00:09:21.141 --&gt; 00:09:22.467
In the optional lab,

140
00:09:22.467 --&gt; 00:09:27.417
you see an interactive plot that attempts
to classify between two categories.

141
00:09:27.417 --&gt; 00:09:32.123
And hopefully notice how this
often doesn't work very well.

142
00:09:32.123 --&gt; 00:09:35.064
Which is okay because that
motivates the need for

143
00:09:35.064 --&gt; 00:09:37.941
a different model to do
classification talks.

144
00:09:37.941 --&gt; 00:09:41.739
So please check out this optional lab and
after that we're

145
00:09:41.739 --&gt; 00:09:46.561
going to the next video to look at
logistic regression for classification.
