    "> 然而，给故事卡编号会给过程增加无谓的开销，并使我们陷入关于需要具体化的功能的抽象讨论。\n",

    "    If you feel compelled to number story cards, instead try adding a short title to the card and use the title as shorthand for the rest of the story text.\n",

    "One of the problems that has plagued every approach to software requirements has been mixing requirements with solution specification. \n",

    "> 最终，用户界面细节将不可避免地渗入故事中。\n",
    "This happens as the software becomes more and more complete, and stories shift away from being entirely new functionality to being modifications or extensions of existing functionality.\n",
    "> 随着软件变得越来越完整，故事从完全新的功能转变为对现有功能的修改或扩展，这种情况就会发生。\n",

    "This story may represent three days of work regardless of whether  it’s  done  at  the  start  or  end  of  the  project.  However,  it  is  not  a  story you’d expect to have at the start of the project before the user interface has even been considered.\n",
    "> 无论是在项目开始还是结束时完成，这个故事可能代表三天的工作。然而，在项目开始之前，你不会期望有这样一个故事，甚至还没有考虑用户界面。"
